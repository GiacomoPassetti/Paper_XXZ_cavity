# Paper_XXZ_cavity

Repo hosting code for 'Light-matter entanglement at quantum criticality' project.

The Folders panel_1, panel_2 and panel_3 contain the codes used to produce all the plots present in the paper, they call the datas from the XXZ folder which contains all the datas produced via DMRG calculations.

To generate the datas contained in the XXZ folder one can use the source code Paper_XXZ_cavity/XXZ/gs_progressive_v5.py

To generate the datas resulting from Meanfield calculation one can use the source code Paper_XXZ_cavity/MF/mf_complete.py

To generate the ground state with the renormalized hopping reported in fig 3b. Paper_XXZ_cavity/XXZ/gs_renormalized_U.py

To execute the programs only standard (openly available) packages are required.
